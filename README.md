# SWinder - Dating simulation inspired by :star:StarWars Universum

This project was created in order to practice working with API and React Router.

## Description

SWinder is an dating-app :cupid: simulation for finding love in a Galaxy far, far away... :wink:  
But really, it's a creative idea for displaying data collected from [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/)

- Depending on what gender you have picked, the app will display your profile picture as a Kylo Ren, Rey or l3-37 droid.
- Choose who are you interested in, and the app will filter through all characters in SWAPI and will randomly select characters suited to your choice.
- The data is stored in Session Storage, so page reload won't result in losing your previous selection.
